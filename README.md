###What does it do?

[Boids](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=37401.37406) was a program designed by Craig Reynolds to simulate the aggregate motion of a flock, swarm, herd or schools of animals. Inspired by this, the Boids package aims to provide an animated output of this simulation of the behaviour of a flock of animals (such as flocks of starlingâ€™s seen on winter evenings in Rome) based on a range of input parameters.

###How to Install

There are two options to install the package: manually download and install, or install directly from GitHub using the standard pip command.
